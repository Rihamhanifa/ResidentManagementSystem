üìñ About The Project
The Resident Management System is a C# Windows Forms desktop application designed to replace the inefficient and error-prone manual, paper-based record-keeping methods used in Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions.
This system provides a secure, centralized, and user-friendly digital solution for GN officers to manage resident information effectively. It automates the entire data management lifecycle, from data entry and validation to quick retrieval and secure storage, thereby improving administrative efficiency and data accuracy.
üéØ Problem Statement
Traditional record-keeping in GN divisions suffers from several critical issues:
High Risk of Human Error: Manual data entry leads to inaccurate and inconsistent records.
Data Vulnerability: Physical documents are susceptible to loss and damage.
Time-Consuming Processes: Searching for and retrieving specific resident information is a slow and manual task.
Lack of Data Validation: There is no mechanism to enforce correct data formatting, leading to poor data quality.
Poor Security: Sensitive personal data is not adequately protected.
This application was built to solve these problems by providing a robust and modern digital alternative.
‚ú® Key Features
Secure User Authentication: Access to the system is protected by a username and password.
Centralized Dashboard: An all-in-one interface to view and manage all resident records.
Full CRUD Functionality: Easy-to-use forms for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting resident data.
Powerful Search: Instantly filter thousands of records by Name, NIC, or Address.
Robust Data Validation:
Checks for required fields (Name, NIC, Address, Gender).
Validates the format for Sri Lankan NICs (both old 10-character and new 12-digit formats).
Validates the format for phone numbers (optional, but must be 10 digits if provided).
User-Friendly Interface:
A clean, modern dark-themed design.
Logical Tab Order for easy keyboard navigation.
Helpful Tooltips to guide the user.
