## üìñ About The Project

The **Resident Management System** is a standalone desktop application designed to digitize and streamline the administrative tasks of Grama Niladhari divisions in Sri Lanka. It replaces traditional, inefficient paper-based record-keeping with a secure, automated digital solution.

This system allows authorized officers to efficiently manage resident data, ensuring accuracy, security, and quick retrieval of information. It was developed as part of the ITE 1943 ICT Project (Level 01) for the Bachelor of Information Technology degree at the University of Moratuwa.

### Key Features
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Role-based login to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Centralized Dashboard:** An intuitive interface for managing all resident records.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Easily Add, View, Update, and Delete resident records.
*   **Powerful Search:** Instantly filter records by Full Name, NIC number, or Address.
*   **Data Validation:** Robust input checks to ensure data integrity (e.g., NIC format, required fields).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use with logical tab ordering and helpful tooltips.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - Primary programming language.

        Password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO users (Username, Password) VALUES ('admin', '123');

    CREATE TABLE residents (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        dob DATE NOT NULL,
        nic VARCHAR(12) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        address TEXT NOT NULL,
        phone VARCHAR(15),
        email VARCHAR(100),
        occupation VARCHAR(50),
        gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') NOT NULL,
        registered_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
